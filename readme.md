Just trying out websockets...

I should have a branch for doing it with socketio, without socketio and MAYBE one with htmx (because less coding is the best kind of coding)

turns out using flask for stuff other than socketio is janky as hell and kind of unnessessary, hx-ws and without socketio branches have not been done
